# REACTJS

---

### What is React
React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

### What are the major features of React
The major features of React are:

- It uses **JSX** syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
- It uses **Virtual DOM** instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
- It supports **server-side rendering** which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
- It follows **Unidirectional or one-way** data flow or data binding.
- It uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

### What is JSX?
_JSX_ stands for _JavaScript XML_ and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.
