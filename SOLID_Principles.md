### Single Responsibility Principle
This principle states that "A class should have only one reason to change" which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose. In other words, a class should have only one job or purpose within the software system.

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Product class representing any item of any ECommerce.
class Product {
public:
    string name;
    double price;
 
    Product(string name, double price) {
        this->name = name;
        this->price = price;
    }
};

// Violating SRP: ShoppingCart is handling multiple responsibilities
class ShoppingCart {
private:
    vector<Product*> products; 

public:
    void addProduct(Product* p) { 
        products.push_back(p);
    }

    const vector<Product*>& getProducts() { 
        return products;
    } 

    // 1. Calculates total price in cart.
    double calculateTotal() {
        double total = 0;
        for (auto p : products) {
            total += p->price;
        }
        return total;
    }

    // 2. Violating SRP - Prints invoice (Should be in a separate class)
    void printInvoice() {
        cout << "Shopping Cart Invoice:\n";
        for (auto p : products) {
            cout << p->name << " - Rs " << p->price << endl;
        }
        cout << "Total: Rs " << calculateTotal() << endl;
    }

    // 3. Violating SRP - Saves to DB (Should be in a separate class)
    void saveToDatabase() {
        cout << "Saving shopping cart to database..." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    ShoppingCart* cart = new ShoppingCart();

    cart->addProduct(new Product("Laptop", 50000));
    cart->addProduct(new Product("Mouse", 2000));

    cart->printInvoice();  
    cart->saveToDatabase();

### Open Closed Principle
This principle states that "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification" which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

### Liskov's Substitution Principle
The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle "Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes". This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behaviour.

### Interface Segregation Principle
This principle is the first principle that applies to Interfaces instead of classes in SOLID and it is similar to the single responsibility principle. It states that "do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them". Here your main goal is to focus on avoiding fat interface and give preference to many small client-specific interfaces. You should prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a principle in object-oriented design that states that "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions". Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

- DIP Voilated
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MySQLDatabase {  // Low-level module
public:
    void saveToSQL(string data) {
        cout << "Executing SQL Query: INSERT INTO users VALUES('" << data << "');" << endl;
    }
};

class MongoDBDatabase {  // Low-level module
public:
    void saveToMongo(string data) {
        cout << "Executing MongoDB Function: db.users.insert({name: '" << data << "'})" << endl;
    }
};

class UserService {  // High-level module (Tightly coupled)
private:
    MySQLDatabase sqlDb;  // Direct dependency on MySQL
    MongoDBDatabase mongoDb;  // Direct dependency on MongoDB

public:
    void storeUserToSQL(string user) {
        // MySQL-specific code
        sqlDb.saveToSQL(user);  
    }

    void storeUserToMongo(string user) {
        // MongoDB-specific code
        mongoDb.saveToMongo(user);  
    }
};

int main() {
    UserService service;
    service.storeUserToSQL("Aditya");
    service.storeUserToMongo("Rohit");
}
```
- DIP Followed
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstraction (Interface)
class Database {
public:
    virtual void save(string data) = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

// MySQL implementation (Low-level module)
class MySQLDatabase : public Database {
public:
    void save(string data) override {
        cout << "Executing SQL Query: INSERT INTO users VALUES('" << data << "');" << endl;
    }
};

// MongoDB implementation (Low-level module)
class MongoDBDatabase : public Database {
public:
    void save(string data) override {
        cout << "Executing MongoDB Function: db.users.insert({name: '" << data << "'})" << endl;
    }
};

// High-level module (Now loosely coupled)
class UserService {
private:
    Database* db;  // Dependency Injection

public:
    UserService(Database* database) {  
        db = database;
    }
    
    void storeUser(string user) {
        db->save(user);
    }
};

int main() {
    MySQLDatabase mysql;
    MongoDBDatabase mongodb;

    UserService service1(&mysql);
    service1.storeUser("Aditya");

    UserService service2(&mongodb);
    service2.storeUser("Rohit");
}
```
