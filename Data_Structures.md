# DATA STRUCTURES

### What is Data Structure
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program.

### What are the types of Data Structure
**Linear Data Structure** : A data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. Examples are array, stack, queue, etc.
**Non-linear Data Structure** : Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. Examples are trees and graphs.

### What are the Applications of Data Structure
**Databases** : Data structures are used to organize and store data in a database, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation.
**Operating systems** : Data structures are used in the design and implementation of operating systems to manage system resources, such as memory and files.
**Computer graphics** : Data structures are used to represent geometric shapes and other graphical elements in computer graphics applications.
**Artificial intelligence** : Data structures are used to represent knowledge and information in artificial intelligence systems.

### What is Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers (in C or C++) or references (in Java, Python and JavaScript). Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list, as the nodes are not stored contiguously in memory.

### What is Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It behaves like a stack of plates, where the last plate added is the first one to be removed.

### What is Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates like a line where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
